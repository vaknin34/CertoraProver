/**
 * A DSL builder for patterns. For example, to match adding 0x40 to some variable, you would do the following:
 *
 * PatternDSL.build { (Var + 0x40()).locFirst }
 *
 * This builds a pattern which matches Var + 0x40 and gives the location and the variable being matched against.
 *
 * The basic building blocks (the base cases) are the Const and Var functions: these can be supplied with predicates
 * to narrow the variables/constants to match against. The no-arg version match any constant and argument and return as the
 * match payload the variable/constant matched. As a convenience, to match a specific constant/variable, there are the Const(BigInteger)
 * and Var(TACSymbol.Var) versions. For even less verbosity you may use the overloaded operators ! for variables and () for constants.
 * So to match `someTacVar` exactly, you need simply write `!someTacVar` and to match the constant `0x40` exactly you need only write `0x40()`.
 *
 * ## Complex operations
 *
 * Patterns will often match against binary/unary operations, often arbitrarily nested. To support naturally building these
 * patterns, the DSL uses the [PatternBuilder] class. A [PatternBuilder] is a thin wrapper around a [PatternMatcher.Pattern]
 * but which is extended to support many common binary operations. For example, suppose we have `p` and `q` each
 * of which match some arbitrary piece of code. To match code that adds together two arguments which are defined by `p` and `q`
 * we can simply write `p + q`. However, this does *not* actually yield a [PatternBuilder]; `p + q` gives no information about
 * how the result payloads of `p` and `q` should be combined. To that end, the object ([Coalesce2]) returned has a method [withAction][Coalesce2.withAction]
 * which specifies the combiner for the results of `p` and `q` and defines the overall match payload of the pattern `p + q`.
 * Thus, you need to write `p + q.withAction { where, pRes, qRes -> ... }` Then `where` parameter here is the [LTACCmd] at the point
 * the match on `+` occurred.
 *
 * As a convenience, the object returned by the binary operations provide [first][Coalesce2.first] and [locFirst][Coalesce2.locFirst]
 * fields which yield a [PatternBuilder] that returns the left pattern payload or the left pattern payload AND the match location as a pair
 * respectively. [second][Coalesce2.second] and [locSecond][Coalesce2.locSecond] are similarly defined.
 *
 * ## Commutativity
 *
 * Sometimes operations such as `+` and `*` are commutative and thus the patterns should be commutative as well. By default the
 * pattern matcher does *not* commute patterns unless explicitly requested: certain DSL operations will return a [Coalesce2] extended
 * with a `commute` method. This commute method returns a [Coalesce2] which when provided an action will actualy yield a pattern
 * that matches EITHER `p + q` or `q + p` for addition, `p * q` OR `q * p` for multiplication etc.
 *
 * ## Naming and debugging
 *
 * It is hard to debug the low-level internal pattern machinery. To aid in diagnosing pattern bugs, [PatternBuilders][PatternBuilder]
 * and [Coalesce2] objects have a `named` method which allows an informative name to be given to a pattern. By default
 * this name does nothing, but if the pattern debug level is activated, patterns with names will verbosely log their operations.
 *
 * ### Note
 *
 * The [Coalesce2] and [PatternBuilder] objects are meant to be used in a fluent API style and intermediate objects should
 * not be stored and re-used. This is especially important w.r.t. naming which is actually implemented using side-effects
 * and could behave unpredictably if a [PatternBuilder] or [Coalesce2] is reused in multiple contexts.
 *
 * ## Logical Operations
 *
 * In addition to the usual arithmetic operations, the PatternDSL allows combining patterns with logical operations. In
 * particular, `p ^ q` may be used to combine two [PatternBuilders][PatternBuilder] with identical payload types, yielding
 * a pattern that matches EITHER q OR q, i.e., the XOR operation.
 *
 * To perform a short-circuiting logical or, use the `lor` infix function. `p lor q` will attempt to match `p` and only
 * if it fails to match will it attempt to match `q`
 *
 * ## Advanced patterns (Not yet extensively tested)
 *
 * For totally general matching you can lift an extractor function into a function in the DSL. Any function that takes
 * an [LTACCmd] and an [TACCmd.Simple.AssigningCmd] and returns either a `TACSymbol?` or `Pair<TACSymbol, TACSymbol>?`
 * may be lifted into a pattern builder function via the `lift` function. These functions should examine the assigning cmd,
 * and if the assigning form is acceptable return the operand (resp. operands) which should be sub-matched on. For example,
 * to embed a match on calldataload, one could write:
 *
 * ```
 * { _: LTACCmd, b: TACCmd.Simple.AssigningCmd -> if(b is TACCmd.Simple.AssigningCmd.ByteLoadFromRO && b.base == TACKeyword.CALLDATA.toVar()) { b.loc } else { null } }.lift()
 * ```
 *
 * The result of the above lift operation is a function that expects a [PatternBuilder] which will be used to sub-match on
 * the extracted argument (in this example, the location in the calldata array). Suppose we wanted to match an index that is exactly zero: then
 * we would have:
 *
 * ```
 * { _: LTACCmd, b: TACCmd.Simple.AssigningCmd -> /* as before */ }.lift()(0x0()).withAction { ... }
 * ```
 *
 * In the case where the function returns a pair, the object returned after invoking the function also supports the `commute`
 * operation, to indicate the arguments can be supplied in any order.

      * A common interface for objects that are not yet pattern builders, but know how to transform themselves into a [PatternBuilder];
      * in fact, a [PatternBuilder] is itself a [Buildable]. Implementations of [Buildable] that are not pattern builders represent
      * logic to match some fragment of code without any information (yet) about what to do with the result of that match. In particular,
      * Coalesce2 and CommutativeCoalesce2 both represent logic to match a binary operation that does not yet have explicit information

      * which is to simply return the payloads of the binary operation as a pair.

/**
 * A predicate for checking where a symbol at some location either:
 * 1. Fails to meet some criteria
 * 2. De novo meets some matching criteria, or
 * 3. Is a variable that is subject to further matching.
 *
 * These three cases are the different instantions of the [analysis.PatternMatcher.Continuation] class.
 *
 * This type is used as a "pre-filter" on the symbols that are subject to further matching.
 * Every pattern knows how to declare the type of symbol they expect to match on. For example,
 * `a + b` cannot match against the constant 15, but the literal variable `x` could, provided `x` itself
 * is definitely defined as `x := 15`.
 *
 * In other words, this type represents logic to say:
 * "I know this symbol matches the pattern, or "It definitely DOES NOT match the pattern", or
 * "it's a variable, and we'll have to check its definition sites to be sure".
 *
 * It is expected (but not checked) that a pattern's [SymbolPredicate] is "coherent" w.r.t. immediate results
 * on variables. That is, if a pattern P's symbol predicate indicates that a variable V matches at L with payload X,
 * then invoking the compiled P's query function on V at L should also return X.
 *
 * Note that the [PatternMatcher.Continuation.SubQuery] object takes a [TACSymbol.Var]. It is expected
 * (but not currently checked) that this field *must* be the same object (as determined by reference equality)
 * to the input argument, i.e., the symbol predicate must construct the [analysis.PatternMatcher.Continuation.SubQuery]
 * object via a checked (or unchecked) downcast. Ideally we'd somehow encode that returning [analysis.PatternMatcher.Continuation.SubQuery]
 * must prove that the argument is a [TACSymbol.Var], but we can't do that with Kotlin's baby contract system.

/**
 * Utility class for *syntactic* matching over TAC code.
 *
 * ## Patterns
 * The pattern objects are heart of the Pattern matcher. Each [Pattern] represents some logic on how to match the definition
 * of a variable against a particular syntactic pattern, and on a successful match some logic on how to transform that match
 * into a useful result. It bears repeating: every pattern is ultimately a way to check whether a variable v at some point L
 * is definitely defined according to some syntactic pattern.
 *
 * Patterns naturally compose: a pattern that matches an addition operation can specify that its operands must be defined
 * according to some other patterns, see below for what this means.
 *
 * ## On Matching
 * Each [Pattern] is independent of any particular piece of TAC code.
 * rather the pattern must be compiled via the [PatternMatcher.compilePattern]
 * function. The [SymbolQuery] class returned by this [compilePattern] provides methods for
 * determining whether a variable v at some program point l is defined according to the compiled pattern.
 *
 * Note that in the presence of variable redeclaration, a pattern can match for a particular variable at one
 * point in the program and not in another. This should be relatively rare for anything but loop variables and tac globals (keywords).
 *
 * The behavior of nested matching follows from the above. Suppose we have a pattern that specifies that a variable should
 * be defined according to `op(p1, p2)` where `op` is some operation (a word load, a binary expression, etc.) and `p1` and `p2`
 * are themselves patterns.
 *
 * As matching is (assumed) to be performed over TAC code, the composition of `p1` and `p2` with the matching logic for
 * `op` is relatively simple. Suppose we issue a query for the definition of `v` at `L` (see the documentation for [SymbolQuery]
 * for the calling conventions). The matcher returned by [compilePattern] will first find the definitely reaching definition
 * site for `v at `L` if it exists. Call this definition side D. If there is no such D, the match fails. Otherwise, it checks the RHS of the definition to see
 * if it is of the form `op(x, y)` where x and y are TACSymbol. NB that the pattern matcher does not (and probably will not)
 * consider nested expressions, but as stated above our code is almost always in TAC form anyway, so this is not so much of a restriction.
 *
 * By default, most patterns will follow "trivial" def chains, that is, if you specify that x should be defined according to `a + b`
 * and x is defined by:
 * y = a + b
 * x = y
 *
 * The definition of `x := y` is considered to match.
 *
 * To check that the operands of `op` satisfy the patterns `p1` and `p2` the pattern matching process is invoked recursively.
 * That is, a matcher for `p1` will be queried for `x` at `D`, and similarly, a matcher for `p2` will be queried for `y` at `D`.
 * If `p1` and `p2` themselves have nested pattern this process repeats.
 *
 * If `p1` and `p2` both match, their results are combined via some logic specified in the original pattern, and the result is
 * returned as the result of the query. This "all or nothing" approach is not fundamental, indeed, the logical combinators
 * will sometimes expect one or more of their subpatterns to fail.

              If we are here, then this is a top-level query, or one of our symbol predicates returned subquery.
              The tricky case here is if we had p1 return SubQuery(s) and p2 returned Match(d) from their symbol queries.
              We need to be sure that, if p1 fails, invoking p2's pattern matcher gives back Match(d).

              Because we are here, we know that q must be s, the symbol passed to the symbol predicates, which
              was returned wrapped in the SubQuery. Further, from the constraint that symbolpredicates must be
              coherent w.r.t to the query, we know that if p2 returned Match from its symbol predicate, we can get
              that result back from p2's matcher.

              NB we are so certain about this invariant because the only non-trivial symbol predicates (i.e., is it a variable?
              subquery, otherwise no match) are those which are matching specific constants and variables. For matching on literal
              constants, coherence between the query and the symbolpredicate is moot: you can't query on a constant, so the
              only *real* result on a constant is Match or NoMatch. So what about variables? Well, the public API through which
              these symbolpredicates/queries are constructed just expose a predicate which returns a variable continuation,
              in other words, the results must be coherent because they are using the exact same logic (i.e., predicate)
              under the hood.
