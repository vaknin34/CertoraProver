/**
 * Class to analyze (and instrument) the myriad ways that solidity manages the data returned from an external call.
 *
 * For statically sized return sizes, solidity generates (roughly):
 * ```
 * returndatasize = havoc
 * rc = call outSize = k, outOffset = fp
 * if rc != 0 {
 *    if returndatasize < k {
 *       len = returndatasize
 *    } else {
 *       len = k
 *    }
 *    retBuffer = fp
 *    fp = retBuffer + roundup(len)
 *    if len < k {
 *       revert()
 *    }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Note that this is the happy path, when the call is known to not pass a value. If it does, then before the `if rc != 0` we instead have:
 * ```
 * if balance[to] + value > MAX_UINT || value > balance[this] {
 *    rc = 0
 *    returndatasize = 0
 * } else {
 *    returndatasize = havoc
 *    transfer(value, to, from)
 *    rc = call outSize = k, outOffset = fp
 *    if rc == 0 {
 *       transfer(value, from, to)
 *    }
 * }
 * if rc != 0 { ibid }
 * ```
 *
 * In this latter case especially, correlating the return buffer being accessed to the definite proceeding call is difficult.
 *
 * However, this is just one possible pattern. Solidity may also do this:
 * ```
 * ... as before ...
 * if rc != 0 {
 *    retBuffer = fp
 *    fp = retBuffer + roundUp(returndatasize)
 *    if returndatasize < k { revert() }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Note that even if we recognized this allocations as statically sized blocks, we don't actually see an initialization:
 * we are relying on the call command's implicit copying of returndata.
 *
 * But this is only for statically sized outputs. For dynamically sized outputs, we have:
 *
 * ```
 * rc = call outSize = 0, outOffset = fp
 * if rc != 0 {
 *    sz = returndatasize
 *    buffStart = fp
 *    mem[buffStart:sz] = returndata[0:sz]
 *    fp = buffStart + roundup(sz)
 *    // use buffStart as if it was the start of the element segment of an array with length sz
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * In this case, we see the explicit copy, but the object shape we are allocating isn't something we support, there is no length
 * field.
 *
 * The solution is to use a *very* specialized static analysis to recognize these allocations, and then instrument the allocations
 * as appropriate. In the dynamic case, we make the allocation look like a "real" array:
 * ```
 * dummyStart = fp // inserted
 * buffStart = dummyStart + 0x20 // modified
 * mem[dummyStart] = sz // inserted
 * mem[buffStart:sz] = returndata[0:sz]
 * fp = buffStart + roundup(sz)
 * ```
 *
 * After this instrumentation, it looks like a real allocation properly intialized.
 *
 * For the constant block case we remove any dynamic sizes from the allocation, and rewrite it to be
 * ```
 * retBuffer = fp
 * mem[retBuffer:k] = returndata[0:k]
 * fp = retBuffer + k
 * ```
 *
 * We've now made the allocation look like a constant sized block, and we've added the explicit initialization thereof.
 *
 * The details of the analysis are explained within the class.

     * A representation of the lifecycle of a returnbuffer allocation. Each subtype of this
     * class represents a state of the allocation, the `transition*` methods
     * are called when events happen during the traversal of the program starting from the call.
     * In response to these events the state may transition to the error state (represented by the [Either.Right]
     * component), to another state, or to the same state. The whole process starts in the [ExpectReturnSize],
     * and by the end of the allocation, we expect to be in a "sufficient" state (see below).
     * All *potentially* sufficient states are subtypes of [PotentiallyCompleteState] and for which
     * we have at least seen an FP write that occurs after a call; this is precisely the predicate that the [isSufficientTrace]
     * function checks.
     *
      A "sufficient state" is not to be confused with a [HaltingState].
     * A [HaltingState] is a state in which the analysis cannot (or should not) proceed but which do not (necessarily)
     * indicate an analysis failure. These can be reached via two means:
     * 1. The analysis detected that is on an uninteresting path (e.g., we have entered a branch where the RC == 0), (this is the [Halt] state) or
     * 2. We have seen a write of the FP, but have reached a command with an "illegal" operation that prevent us continuing (the [ProcessingComplete] state)
     *
     * A good question is why we need to ever continue after seeing the FP write at all, that is, why don't
     * we immediately transition to a successful [HaltingState] once we see an FP write? As described in the
     * documentation for the [ReturnBufferAnalysis] class itself, the allocation sometimes isn't known to be a
     * return buffer allocation until we reach the end of the block after the fp write and check its
     * path conditions. However, to insure that the eventual transformation we do is sound, we need some strict guarantees about
     * what happens between the FP write and the end of the block: namely we don't kill any aliases
     * of the FP, we don't read memory etc. Note that these checks are precisely what we check *before* the FP write.
     * So it is convenient to just continue the analysis until the end of the block after the FP write if possible.
     * Then, if the analysis can reach the end of the block in this way, it is safe to consider its path condition to
     * judge whether something is a return allocation.
     *
     * Note that in principle we *could* have always stopped the analysis at the FP write, and then spawned an adhoc
     * analysis if necessary to see if we can safely reach the end of the block, but this was judged to be,
     * in technical parlance, an enormous pain in the ass.
     *
     * To ground this conversation, let's look at two examples. In the following snippets, we're assumed to be in some
     * rc != 0 branch following a call with static outsize k, and p is an alias of the fp at the call.
     *
     * In the first case, we have
     * ```
     * if returndatasize() < k { revert }
     * fp = p + k
     * use(mem[p])
     * ```
     *
     * After the FP write we immediately see a use of memory, which means that our analysis has to judge whether we have a
     * return allocation based on what it has seen up until the FP write; if we use information that comes after the program
     * has already started using memory, we potentially make unsound changes.
     *
     * Compare this with the following:
     * ```
     * w = returndatsize()
     * fp = p + w
     * if w < 0x40 { revert }
     * ```
     *
     * For us to conclude that we are (probably) allocating static array to hold the returndata, we need to reach the end of the
     * block and consult the path condition, but we need a little bit of slack between when the allocation is complete
     * and it starts being accessed in order to be confident in our findings.
     *
     * A quick aside: even with this song and dance around forbidding memory accesses between the FP write and
     * the end of the block, we can still have an unsound rewrite, consider:
     *
     * ```
     * w = returndatasize()
     * fp = p + w
     * if w < 0x40 { revert }
     * mem[fp] = ...;
     * use(mem[p+0x40])
     * ```
     *
     * Can the write at the new value of the `fp` be observed by `mem[p+0x40]`? In the original code, it depends on
     * the returndatasize. However, after our rewrite triggers, we'll have:
     *
     * ```
     * w = returndatasize()
     * if w < 0x40 { revert }
     * mem[p:0x40] = returndata[0:0x40]
     * fp = p + 0x40
     * mem[fp] = ...;
     * use(mem[p + 0x40])
     * ```
     *
     * Now the read definitely interferes with the write, even if the pointer analysis (correctly) fails. However, this
     * scenario is so absolutely cursed, this rewrite doesn't try to account for this use case.
     *
     * The transitions of the system are as follows:
     * * [ExpectReturnSize] => [transitionReturnHavoc] => [ExpectCallCore]
     *   Represents `returndatasize = *` encountered before the callcore. After this, the next event we see must
     *   be the callcore command, as which is what [ExpectCallCore] represents.
     * * [ExpectReturnSize] => [transitionReturnZero] => [ExpectCallSummary]
     *   Represents the `returndatasize = 0` which is added if the balance transfer fails. Note that along this path,
     *   we do not expect to see a callcore, but the decompiler/simplifier *does* still insert the [vc.data.TACCmd.EVM.CallOpcodeSummary],
     *   which we do expect to see.
     * * [ExpectCallCore] => [transitionCallCore] => [ExpectCallSummaryPostCallCore] with [ExpectCallSummaryPostCallCore.k]
     *   Unsurprisingly, when we expect to see a call core and then see a call core, we transition to another state
     *   [ExpectCallSummaryPostCallCore]; which means we expect to see the [vc.data.TACCmd.EVM.CallOpcodeSummary] inserted by
     *   the decompiler after this [vc.data.TACCmd.Simple.CallCore]. Note that this state is *different* from [ExpectCallSummary];
     *   that state is only reached if we do not expect to see a call core at all. The parameter `k` is the static return size declared
     *   for the output buffer. If we cannot infer this constant value, we instead transition to the error state.
     * * [ExpectCallSummary] => [transitionCallSummary] => [ExpectCallClose] with [ExpectCallClose.declaredOutSize]
     *   If we are expecting a call summary and encounter one, transition to [ExpectCallClose], which indicates
     *   the next event is encountering the [TACMeta.CALL_GROUP_END] annotation. Like the case above, we extract
     *   the constant declared outsize (which is available in the [vc.data.TACCmd.EVM.CallOpcodeSummary]).
     * * [ExpectCallSummaryPostCallCore] => [transitionCallSummary] => [ExpectCallClose] with [ExpectCallClose.declaredOutSize] = [ExpectCallSummaryPostCallCore.k]
     *   Expecting to see a call summary, we simply transition to the [ExpectCallClose] class, passing along the previously
     *   inferred static outsize [ExpectCallClose.declaredOutSize].
     * * [ExpectCallClose] => [transitionCallClose] => [ExpectRCBound] with [ExpectRCBound.outSize] = [ExpectCallClose.declaredOutSize]
     *   After encountering the (expected) [TACMeta.CALL_GROUP_END] annotation, transition to a state where we expect
     *   to enter a branch where [TACKeyword.RETURNCODE] is non-zero, i.e., the called code did not revert. We plumb through the [ExpectCallClose.declaredOutSize].
     * * [ExpectRCBound] => [transitionRCDefinitelyNonZero] => [SuccessPath], with [SuccessPath.successPathStart] == `p`, [SuccessPath.declaredOutSize] == [ExpectRCBound.outSize]
     *   Indicates that we have entered a path where the [TACKeyword.RETURNCODE] is non-zero, and thus we now expect
     *   to see an allocation (update of the FP) of the data returned from this successful call. p is the command pointer at which
     *   we see the bound on [TACKeyword.RETURNCODE].
     * * [SuccessPath] => [transitionFPWrite] => [SuccessPath]
     *   Indicates that we have now seen an FP update, and the allocation is complete. If we already saw an FP write (as
     *   recorded in [SuccessPath.seenFPWrite] != null, we instead transition an error state.
     * * [SuccessPath] => [transitionReturnDataCopy] => [SuccessPath]
     *   Indicates that we've seen an explicit data copy before the allocation, which happens for dynamic allocations (hence
     *   the condition on the declared outsize being 0). The current pointer `loc`, is recorded along side the existing
     *   results in [SuccessPath]. If there has already been a return data copy, we instead transition to an error.
     * * [ExpectRCBound] => [transitionRCDefinitelyNonZero] => [Halt]
     *   Indicates that we have started down the path for when the callee reverted, and we should stop
     * * [ExpectRCBound] => [transitionRCMaybeZero] => [ExpectRCBound]
     *   Indicates no change to the status of the RC.
     * * [SuccessPath] => [transitionRCMaybeZero] => \bot
     * * [SuccessPath] => [transitionRCDefinitelyZero] => \bot
     *   Indicates an unexpected departure from the code path where the call is known to succeed. This is treated as an error
     * * all others => [transitionRCDefinitelyZero] => same
     * * all others => [transitionRCDefinitelyNonZero] => same
     * * all others => [transitionRCMaybeZero] => same
     *   In any other state, changes in the state of the RC do not matter.
     * * all others => any other transition => \bot
     *
     * Any other transition in any state is an error
