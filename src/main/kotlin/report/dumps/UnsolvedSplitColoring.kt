/**
 * Given a program [tacProgram], and a set of blocks that are part of unsolved subprograms (i.e. splits that timed out),
 * this will return a CodeMap of [tacProgram] where all the nodes that lie on some unsolved split are colored orange and
 * the others green.
 *
 * More intuitively, the green color means "this node was successfully proven correct", while orange means we timed out
 * when attempting to prove that node correct.
 * A node (program block) being "correct" means that there is no violating execution of [tacProgram] that passes
 * through it.
 * (Note that I chose orange rather than red, because the "unsolved" information is less definite than the "solved"
 *  one -- a node that is orange might be hard to solve, but it might also just lie "on the way" to such a node.)
