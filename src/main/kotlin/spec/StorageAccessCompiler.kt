/**
 * Accumulator object that (unsurprisingly) accumulates the steps of compiling a complex storage access. This accumulator
 * is extended and then passed to the "next" continuation as the recursion of [StorageAccessCompiler.compileInternal] unwinds,
 * see that method for details.
 *
 * Conceptually the accumulator represents the state of the "in-flight" access: as each portion of the access
 * path is traversed, the accumulator is updated to reflect the most recent "step" of the path. Thus, each accumulator object
 * represents the state of the access after some number of steps of the access; the instance passed to the final continuation
 * is the state after the access path is completely processed. Put another way, the accumulator represents a "pointer" into
 * storage, where each step moves the pointer farther along the access path. Thus, it makes sense to view this
 * pointer as "pointing" some conceptual value. For example, if `a` is a mapping, then while processing `contract.a[key]`
 * the accumulator produced after simply processing `contract.a` (NB, no array dereference) "points to" the mapping value,
 * despite that not being a discrete, scalar value in the EVM or CVT.
 *
 * In the following documentation for member fields, it should be understood that the state being described is immediately
 * after some most recent "step" along the access path, and that step has positioned the "pointer" represented by
 * the accumulator at some (conceptual) value.
 *
 * [path] is the [analysis.storage.StorageAnalysisResult.NonIndexedPath] of the value pointed to by the accumulator. For an intermediate
 * accumulator, this path may not necessarily correspond to a decomposed path found in a contract's state variables. However, when
 * the traversal terminates, it *is* expected that this [analysis.storage.StorageAnalysisResult.NonIndexedPath] will
 * be found on one of the contract's state variables, see [StorageAccessCompiler.toStorageVar] for more details.
 *
 * [storageType] is the TAC storage type of the value pointed to by the accumulator; this is primarily used to
 * resolve sub-word offset information and to determine slot offsets for struct fields.
 *
 * [vmType] is the [VMTypeDescriptor] version of the [storageType]; it is an invariant that these two fields must have
 * the same "shape", i.e., if [vmType] is a [VMStructDescriptor] then [storageType] will be [TACStorageType.Struct].
 *
 * [ptr] is the symbol which holds the current location of the pointer in storage. As with the [path], the value of this symbol
 * has no meaningful interpretation for an in-flight accumulator, but once all steps of the
 * access are processed, the pointer is expected be a valid index into storage which corresponds to the location of
 * the value being accessed.
 *
 * [code] holds the program fragment which effects the updates to [ptr] and holds the compilation of the map keys and
 * array indices encountered during traversal.
 *
 * [offsetInBytes] (if non-null) gives the sub-word offset of a scalar value. This will only be non-null for integral
 * types (which, by definition, only occur at the terminus of the access path).
 *
 * [displayPath] is used much later in the pipeline, for the purpose of identifying and pretty-printing this storage access.
 * Unfortunately, while at first glance this may look similar to [path], we cannot directly compute this from a [StorageAnalysisResult.NonIndexedPath].
